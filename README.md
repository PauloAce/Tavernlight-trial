This is a repository for the Tavernlight trial.

This contains only the answers to question 1 to 4 of the trial, which involved the fixing or improving of code snippets in Lua and C++.
I struggled to create an environement using TFS and the OTclient, which hindered my progress on the remaining tasks.
I worked on this for most of the trial and there was not enough progress to get the environment set up, so I have only provided the answers given in this repository.

Thank you for this opportunity and I hope that even with full completion of the task that I can show off something of my experience.
